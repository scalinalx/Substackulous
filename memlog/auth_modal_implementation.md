# Auth Modal Implementation

## Date: March 5, 2023

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Auth Modal Component
- Created a new `AuthModal` component in `src/components/auth-modal.tsx`
- Used the existing Dialog component from shadcn/ui
- Integrated the existing `LoginForm` component into the modal

### 2. Updated Home Page
- Added state for controlling the auth modal: `const [isAuthModalOpen, setIsAuthModalOpen] = useState(false)`
- Added the `AuthModal` component to the page
- Modified the "GET STARTED" button in the announcement bar to open the auth modal instead of scrolling to pricing
- Updated the "Start Free Trial" button in the hero section to also open the auth modal

### 3. Benefits
- Improved user experience by allowing users to sign up or log in directly from any part of the landing page
- Maintained the existing authentication flow and components
- Consistent with the existing modal pattern used for the video modal

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a sign-up tab to the auth modal to allow users to choose between signing in and signing up
- Add analytics tracking for the auth modal to measure conversion rates
- Test the auth modal on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it works well on mobile
