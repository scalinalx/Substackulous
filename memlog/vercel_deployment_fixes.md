# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Date: March 5, 2023

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Image Optimization
- Replaced `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` components in:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (logo images)
  - `src/components/all-in-one-advantage.tsx` (feature image)
- This improves performance by enabling automatic image optimization, resulting in faster LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) and reduced bandwidth usage.

### 2. Unescaped Entities
- Fixed unescaped single quotes in:
  - `src/components/all-in-one-advantage.tsx`
  - `src/components/testimonials.tsx`
  - `src/components/testimonials1.tsx`
- Replaced `'` with `&apos;` to properly escape single quotes in JSX.

### 3. React Hook Dependencies
- Fixed React Hook useCallback dependencies in `src/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:
  - Removed unnecessary `supabase` dependency from three useCallback hooks
  - This resolves the React Hook exhaustive-deps warnings

### 4. AuthProvider Missing Error
- Fixed "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" error by:
  - Adding the ClientLayout component to the root layout
  - This ensures that the AuthProvider is available throughout the application
  - The error was occurring because dashboard pages were using the useAuth hook but the AuthProvider wasn't in the component tree

### 5. Static Generation Issues
- Fixed static generation errors during build by:
  - Creating config files with `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` for dashboard and login pages
  - Updating next.config.js to exclude dashboard and login pages from static generation
  - This prevents Next.js from trying to statically generate pages that use client-side authentication
  - The error was occurring because Next.js was trying to prerender pages at build time, but the AuthProvider is a client component

## Benefits
- Improved performance with optimized images
- Fixed React linting errors that were preventing successful deployment
- Ensured proper JSX syntax with escaped entities
- Fixed authentication context errors
- Resolved static generation issues
- Enabled successful deployment to Vercel

## Next Steps
- Monitor the deployment to ensure all issues are resolved
- Consider implementing additional performance optimizations
- Review other components for similar issues to proactively fix them
