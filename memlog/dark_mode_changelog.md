# Dark Mode Implementation Changelog

## Date: [Current Date]

### Task: Enable Dark Mode in All Dashboard Pages

#### Changes Made:

1. Updated `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`:
   - Added dark mode background classes to the main container
   - This ensures all child pages inherit the dark background

2. Updated individual dashboard page components:
   - Added dark mode classes to `ThumbnailsContent.tsx`
   - Added dark mode classes to `HomeRunContent.tsx`
   - Applied consistent styling for headings, text, cards, and UI elements

3. Created a utility file `src/lib/utils/darkModeClasses.ts`:
   - Defined common dark mode classes for consistent styling
   - Added helper function to combine multiple class strings
   - This will make it easier to maintain consistent dark mode styling across all pages

#### Benefits:

- Consistent dark mode experience across all dashboard pages
- Improved accessibility for users who prefer dark mode
- Reduced eye strain in low-light environments
- Better integration with the dark mode toggle in the navigation bar

#### Next Steps:

- Continue applying dark mode classes to remaining dashboard pages
- Test dark mode appearance across different screen sizes
- Consider adding user preference persistence for dark/light mode
- Monitor for any contrast issues in dark mode
