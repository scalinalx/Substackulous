### Implementation Details:

The implementation follows a two-part approach:

1. **Navigation Enhancement**:
   - Added the troubleshooting link to the account section of the sidebar
   - Ensured consistent styling with other sidebar elements
   - Maintained responsiveness in both collapsed and expanded states

2. **Content Implementation**:
   - Used dangerouslySetInnerHTML to render the HTML content (necessary for the complex formatting)
   - Improved the formatting for better readability and user experience
   - Added responsive image containers with proper alt tags for accessibility
   - Implemented dark mode support for all content elements

### Technical Notes:

- The page uses the Next.js Link component for navigation
- Authentication is handled via the AuthContext
- The images should be placed in the public/images directory for proper rendering
- A fixImagePaths function was implemented to ensure correct image path references

### Next Steps:

- Add the actual images to the public/images directory
- Consider adding more troubleshooting sections as needed
- Monitor user feedback on the troubleshooting guide's effectiveness
