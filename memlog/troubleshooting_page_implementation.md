### Implementation Details:

The implementation follows a multi-part approach:

1. **Navigation Enhancement**:
   - Added the troubleshooting link to the account section of the sidebar for authenticated users
   - Ensured consistent styling with other sidebar elements
   - Maintained responsiveness in both collapsed and expanded states

2. **Content Implementation**:
   - Used dangerouslySetInnerHTML to render the HTML content (necessary for the complex formatting)
   - Improved the formatting for better readability and user experience
   - Added responsive image containers with proper alt tags for accessibility
   - Implemented dark mode support for all content elements
   - Created a modal version for non-logged-in users through the FAQ section and hero section buttons
   - Added a Wikipedia-style table of contents for easy navigation to specific sections in both the dashboard page and modal

### Technical Notes:

- The page uses the Next.js Link component for navigation
- Authentication is handled via the AuthContext
- The images should be placed in the public/images directory for proper rendering
- A fixImagePaths function was implemented to ensure correct image path references
- The table of contents uses anchor links with IDs for each section to enable in-page navigation
- The troubleshooting content is now available through three entry points:
  1. The sidebar link in dashboard (for logged-in users)
  2. The red button in the FAQ section (for all users, including non-logged-in)
  3. The "Help!" button in the hero section (for immediate access from the landing page)
- The same table of contents is implemented in both the dashboard page and modal for consistency

### Next Steps:

- Add the actual images to the public/images directory
- Consider adding more troubleshooting sections as needed
- Monitor user feedback on the troubleshooting guide's effectiveness
