{"note": "Tomorrow, I celebrate 3 years of being sober from drugs and alcohol, and it's been the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\nI had my last drink on November 21, 2021, at a play date at the zoo with my son Evan. I had brought a yeti full of Jameson to the zoo for a 9:00am play date, which would end up being my last drink. It was a blurry moment, and I didn't intend to get sober, but I did want to end my life. I called my mom to ensure Evan would be taken care of without me around. She picked me up 10 minutes later. I spent the rest of the next day sleeping it off, promising to attend a 6:00 pm meeting the next day. Little did I know that this day would mark the beginning of my journey to sobriety. My husband also attended the meeting with me, and he also hasn't had a drink or drug since then either. We do recover!", "likes": 3300}
